# Dainorelis - Words to Lithuanian Songs

Dainorelis is a very quick-and-dirty collection of Lithuanian songs put together
using jQuery Mobile and HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate (source: [https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate))

It saves all the songs on your phone so that you can use it when you're offline.  To save the 
app to your homescreen, select "Add to Home Screen" from Safari on your iPhone (you can
do something similar on Android as well on any reasonably modern smartphone).

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git@github.com:edpeciulis/dainorelis.git`

## TODO

* Add music (for when you forget how the song goes)
* Add sharing (share your favourite songs list with your friends)

## Features

* Lithuanian songs
* Works offline

## Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to improve on this very basic app.
